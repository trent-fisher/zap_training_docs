## Calendar Tips and Tricks

### Quick Event Creation

For simple events:
1. Keep titles short but meaningful
2. Use standard meeting lengths (30 min, 1 hour)
3. Add details in description rather than title

### Managing Multiple Events

If you have many events in one day:
- Use Week or Day view for better visibility
- Add time buffers between events
- Color code by type if possible

### Planning Ahead

- Create placeholder events for tentative bookings
- Update details as they're confirmed
- Remove if booking doesn't materialize

### Avoiding Double-Bookings

- Check calendar before confirming appointments
- Use Week view to spot scheduling conflicts
- Leave buffer time between back-to-back events
